Instructions of the game

Level 1: 
    Nothing much. Just the standard lasso game.

Level 2:
    This level involves the lasso having a horizontal acceleration as well as the
    coin.

Level 3:
    PAIN! Courtesy of bombs. Catch one, back to square one.

Level 4:
    By now you must be thinking collecting a coin is a PITA. Well, now try 3.

Level 5:
    Hmm, you're still alive. You got some skill.
