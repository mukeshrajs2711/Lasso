Instructions of the game

Objective: To complete all the levels of the game as quick as possible

Level 1: 
    The lasso game involves throwing a lasso and looping it to catch a coin
    that bounces of the ground. This is the most basic level to get the 
    player used to the game.

Level 2:
    In this level, the coin is given a horizontal velocity as well to make
    it go in a parabola. Also, the lasso is given a horizontal acceleration
    so as to increase it's horizontal reach.

Level 3:
    In this level, bombs are dropped from the sky which are definitely 
    not the things one wants to catch. Catching these bombs will reset 
    the progress of the player in the same level.

Level 4:
    If catching a coin that is following a fixed trajectory isn't hard enough,
    to make it even more harder, in this level, the coin's direction is 
    completely random every time it jumps of the ground.

Level 5:
    All these levels must've tested the skills of the player. This level is
    designed to test the patience of the player. Get ready for some slow 
    burn. The game is intentionally slowed down to 3fps to make it harder.
